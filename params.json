The hope is that as new software versions are released, \r\nthe prior lab's version will be updated and stored in a new (appropriately named) folder.\r\n\r\nEach lab contains the following four resources:\r\n\r\n+ **Module *n* Lab.md** - Markdown file of lab\r\n+ **Module *n* Lab.docx** - MS Word document of the lab\r\n+ **figures** - Folder containing all images reference in the lab\r\n+ **Lab *n* Data** - Folder containing all data referenced in the lab\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n[Open an issue][7] or [fork and submit a pull request][8] on github, or, email [Richard.Smith@tamucc.edu][6].\r\n\r\n### Curriculum Philosophy\r\n\r\nThis curriculum was developed to bring a complete set of labs using FOSS4G to \r\nthe community.  As educators, we found the amount of ready-made FOSS4G curriculum\r\nlacking, or woefully out of date.  Therefore, with the support of the Department\r\nof Labor, we decided to create the world's first complete FOSS4G curriculum available\r\nfor everyone to use, for free.\r\n\r\n*We do not want this curriculum to die!*  Therefore, the [ICA-OSGeo][1] [Lab at\r\nTexas A&M University - Corpus Christi][2] is spearheading the continued development\r\nand updating of these labs.\r\n\r\n### License: Creative Commons 3.0 License\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Markdown was chosen for these reasons:\r\n\r\n+ [Markdown][3] is easy to learn and contains enough functionality to render the labs.\r\n+ With the lab documents converted to Markdown, GitHub can track all changes\r\nto the document; this is not possible with, say, a Word or PDF document.\r\n+ It is very easy to convert Markdown to multiple other formats using software\r\nsuch as [PanDoc][4].\r\n\r\nEach lab begins with a lab title.\r\n\r\n+ Course titles are always size Header 1 `# GST 10X - Course Title` and are the only size \r\nHeader 1 in the lab document.\r\n\r\nThe lab number and name is listed next.\r\n\r\n+ Lab number and titles are always size Header 2 `## Lab n: Lab Title` and are the\r\nonly size Header 2 in the lab document.\r\n\r\nAn attribution block is next as we always want to give proper attribution.\r\n\r\n+ This Markdown document contains the attribution block: \r\n[Attribution Block for Lab Documents.md][5].\r\n\r\nAn Introduction, Objective, and Video Statement are listed next.\r\n\r\n+ These three sections are always size Header 3 `### Introduction` and are always\r\nsections 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe lab Tasks (logical blocks of content) are next.\r\n\r\n+ The Tasks are always size Header 3 `### Task n - Task Title`.  A lab document \r\ncontains as many Tasks deemed appropriate by the authors.\r\n+ The last Task is always a challenge for the students to attempt on their own\r\nwithout (m)any step-by-step instructions.\r\n\r\nThe last two sections are Conclusion and Questions.\r\n\r\n+ These two sections are always size Header 3 `### Conclusion` and are always\r\nsections 4 and 5 respectively.\r\n\r\nWhen a figure is placed in the lab document, the figure is never provided a number, \r\ninstead, it is referred to by its relative placement to the referring text (ex. \r\nrefer to figure below).  *All figures should be placed within the 'figures' folder \r\nin the same directory as the Markdown document.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.geoforall.org/\r\n[2]: http://www.cbi.tamucc.edu/Geospatial-Computing/\r\n[3]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\r\n[4]: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\r\n[5]: Attribution_Block_for_Lab_Documents.md\r\n[6]: mailto:Richard.Smith@tamucc.edu\r\n[7]: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/\r\n[8]: https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
